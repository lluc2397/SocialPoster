# SocialPoster
A little app that allows me to create, parse and share content on differents social medias (SM) like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and soon Google My business (GMB), Tiktok and Linkedin.

There is a CLI to use the main functions : create a short from an image and share it, resize a downloaded image and share it and finally share a downloaded video.
The CLI can be used to schedule these funtions and use them with crontab.

Other functions avaible are:
-Parse a youtube channel
-Download youtube videos and captions
-Share content across differents SM and do some crosspostage (currently it only supports repost Youtube videos and Facebook posts)

TODOS
(Some can be found on the final.py)
-Create class to post on Linkedin, Tiktok and GMB.
-Generalize more the current class so it would be possible to post some content created "on the fly"
